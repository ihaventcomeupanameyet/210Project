This application keeps the digitalized record of library activity, including add new book to a list of book records including information like author name, publisher, year published and book name. It also keeps a record on book when it is borrowed, including who borrowed the book, his/her phone number and expected date of return.

## Why is this project of interest to you

I am taking WRDS 150 this term, and I am amazed how the UBC library have different library branches to store millions printed documents and DVDs all according the discipline related, while work through the library skill tutorial. A complicated method was introduced in the video tutorial but it is beyond my comprehension. I was deeply impressed on how they keep things in library organized and decide to do something related to this topic.
